I find playing guessing game interesting so I took one on google. After finishing the first round, my computer suddenly shown errors got crashed. Luckily, I was able to dump memory before the crash happened. Could you analyze what was happening in my computer at that time?

P/s: The file guessing_game is not a real virus, it just executes nc and binds at port 30002 in LAN so your antivirus may misunderstand the file as virus. Turn of your antivirus and you can run that file without any worry =)))

P/s2: There will have a netcat connection for you to login and get flag so don't try to find flag in the memory dump because there is no flag in it.
